# Game of Life

<!-- Two implementations of Conway's Game of Life: -->

## A simple, automatic, and browser-running implementation using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and an HTTP local server.

    This version assumes that:
    1. The grid features wrap-around.
    2. The user doesn't require the ability to enter their own initial state i.e. it is randomly generated using JS.
    3. The user doesn't require the ability to stop or pause the game i.e. it creates a continuous pretty visualisation, generation by generation, in the browser.
