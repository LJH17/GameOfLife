Game of Life
------------

Compile by running:
    gcc -ansi -Wall GameOfLife.c -o GameOfLife

Either use one of the included configurations (located in the Configurations folder) or make your own.

The configuration specifies the number and position of cells that are initially live.
The number of initially live cells is provided in the first line of the file.
Then the row/column position of each live cell is provided on a separate line.
For example, the “traffic light” life form is defined by the file 'traffic', which contains:

3
2 1
2 2
2 3

In this case three cells are initially alive, with row/column positions as indicated.

Run the program as follows:

./GameOfLife <initial config file path> <width> <height> <no. of generations>

For example, "./GameOfLife ./Configurations/traffic 7 5 3" gives:

*-------*
|       |
|       |
| XXX   |
|       |
|       |
*-------*


*-------*

|  X    |

#define MAX_WIDTH <int>
#define MAX_HEIGHT <int>
